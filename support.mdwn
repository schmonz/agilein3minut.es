## How you can help

Give me your feedback. The only acceptance tests I've got are your
reactions.

Heard an episode that missed the mark for you, by a lot or a little?
[Tweet at me](https://twitter.com/schmonz) so I can better understand
how to meet your needs.

Heard an episode you particularly appreciate? Share it freely.

Got an idea for a topic (or anything else I might consider doing)?
[Stick it on the
backlog](http://agilein3minut.es/cgi/ikiwiki?do=comment&page=backlog).

Feel like dropping me a few bucks? They'll go toward hosting and
equipment costs, and you'll be encouraging me to keep at it. [Become
a Patreon patron](https://www.patreon.com/schmonz) (thanks!).
