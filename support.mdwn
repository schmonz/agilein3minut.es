## How you can help

The only acceptance tests I've got are your reactions. Heard an
episode that missed the mark for you, by a lot or a little? [Tweet
at me](https://twitter.com/schmonz) so I can better understand how
to meet your needs. Heard an episode you particularly appreciate?
Share it freely.

Got an idea for a topic, or anything else I might consider doing?
[Stick it on the
backlog](https://agilein3minut.es/cgi/ikiwiki?do=comment&page=backlog).

Feel like dropping me a few bucks? They'll go toward hosting and
equipment costs, and you'll be encouraging me to keep at it. As you
