Thanks for the suggestion. I tend to be concrete-minded, so an example would help give me something to coalesce my thoughts around. Could you start me off with a common misunderstanding you've seen, an unhealthy pattern in those conversations, wrong people being included-in or excluded-from them, assumptions that are never questioned and really ought to be, something like that?
