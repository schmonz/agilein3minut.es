[[!meta title="About the Show"]]

_Agile in 3 Minutes_ is a micropodcast about thinking and doing
business effectively.

I don't offer a precise definition of "Agile," because I don't think
we need to judge whether we are or aren't. We just need to

- Make risks visible early,
- Make informed decisions often, and
- Deliver value early and often.

If you agree, this show is for you.

## My Goals

7. Demonstrate my respect for your time, attention, intelligence,
   and humanity.

7. Write, edit, and record every episode with such care that it
   might wind up being your favorite.

7. Release a new episode every week, until I've covered every topic
   you could possibly want to hear about.

7. Experiment freely within these constraints.
