## What I Want

I want it to be the case that every time someone chooses to listen
to an episode of _Agile in 3 Minutes_, they feel their time and
intelligence have been respected. I hope this is already so.

I want it to be the case that every time someone seeks an episode
of _Agile in 3 Minutes_ on the topic of `$FOO`, for all reasonable
values of `$FOO`, that episode exists. Until this is so, I intend
to release a new episode every week.
