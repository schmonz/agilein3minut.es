[[!meta title="About the Show"]]

_Agile in 3 Minutes_ is a micropodcast about thinking and doing
business effectively.

I don't offer a precise definition of "Agile," because I don't
believe we need to judge whether we are or are not. What we need
is to:

- Make risks visible early,
- Make informed decisions often, and
- Deliver value early and often.

If you agree, and you want your thoughts happily provoked, this
show is for you. Try [[the newest episode|index]].

## My Goals

7. Demonstrate my respect for your time, attention, intelligence,
   and humanity.

7. Write, edit, and record every episode with such care that it
   might wind up being your favorite.

7. Release a new episode every week, until I've covered every topic
   you could possibly want to hear about.

7. Experiment freely within these constraints.

## Your Freedoms

Use and reuse the Agile in 3 Minutes audio for anything you like. I'd
love to hear about it.
