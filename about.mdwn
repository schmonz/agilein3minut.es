most do in a way way longer duration."

## My Goals

Every time someone chooses to listen, they feel their time,
intelligence, and humanity are respected. I hope this is already
so.

Every time someone seeks an episode on the topic of `$FOO`, for all
reasonable values of `$FOO`, it exists. Until this is the case, I
intend to release a new episode every week.
