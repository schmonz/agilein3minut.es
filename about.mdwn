Whatever "Agile" might mean, one thing's for sure: it's the opposite
of telling people what to go do. But we don't need a precise
definition of "Agile," because neither of us needs to judge whether
we are or are not. We just need to make risks visible early, make
informed decisions often, and deliver value early and often.

Agile in 3 Minutes is about doing business effectively.

## My Goals

7. Every time someone chooses to listen, they feel their time,
   intelligence, and humanity are respected.

7. Every time someone seeks an episode on the topic of `$FOO`, for
   all reasonable values of `$FOO`, it exists. Until this is the
   case, I intend to release a new episode every week.

7. Every episode could be someone's favorite.
