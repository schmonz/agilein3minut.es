Hi Amatai,

We met at Agile Coach Camp and I had loved listening to your podcast ever since.  I know you took a bit of a break and am encouraged to see you starting back up.

I'd like to add a few topics in the areas that I often see missing in many agile transformations

How to assess and more importantly, help improve the ability of our teams to deliver working software frequently?

Where does an executive fit into Agile?  What can they do to help?  What behaviors and practices need to be reviewed to see if they should be adjusted or eliminated in order for agile to succeed?

How is Agile similar - and different from Lean principles and practices?

I'm sure I'll have more later, but this is what's on my mind right now that I don't always see addressed in agile transformations.

I'm looking forward to seeing you again at Agile and Beyond!
