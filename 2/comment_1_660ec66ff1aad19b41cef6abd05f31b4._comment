I'm wondering if anyone else has found that the episodes that are available through iTunes seem to play poorly with the Podcast app, at least in iOS 7.x.

What I have been finding is that, other than episode 1, when I start to play an episode it will play for about two seconds and then the Podcast app will either freeze, crash, or just end the episode. This is the only podcast where this has happened to me before (out of more than a dozen podcasts that I subscribe to).

I will find some way to listen to them, either on this site or another app, but thought I would let you know in case there is something that could be altered in the recording or distribution to iTunes.

Thanks for your work.
John
