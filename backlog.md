[[!meta title="Product Backlog"]]

## _Ceci n'est pas un Ã©pisode_

This is not the episode about Backlogs. (There hasn't been one yet.
For a full list of episodes, consult the [[archive]].)

This is the backlog for the show, where you can see what's planned
and offer your suggestions.

## A few words from your Product Owner

I'm always going to build and deliver whatever I feel is the
highest-value episode to do next. I won't always know what I'm going
to feel, so this backlog won't always tell you what to expect. But
it'll give you an idea of what I'm thinking about. And if you want
to make sure your idea's got my attention, mention it here.
