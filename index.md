A micropodcast about thinking and doing business effectively.

I don't offer a precise definition of "Agile," because I don't
believe we need to judge whether we are or are not.
What we need is to:

- Make risks visible early,
- Make informed decisions often, and
- Deliver value early and often.

If you agree, and you want your thoughts happily provoked, this show is
for you.
Welcome!
Start from [[the beginning|1]],
then continue in any order you like.
