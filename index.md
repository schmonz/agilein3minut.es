“Before Agile in 3 Minutes, I couldn’t get my team to have a conversation.
Now I have to timebox it.”

# What is this?

A micropodcast about thinking and doing business effectively.


# What isn't this?

I don't offer a precise definition of "Agile," because I don't
believe we need to judge whether we are or are not.


# What _do_ we need?

- To make risks visible early,
- To make informed decisions often, and
- To deliver value early and often.


# Is this show for me?

If you'd like to have your thoughts happily provoked, yes! Welcome.


# Where do I start listening?

Anywhere you like.
(For an overview, I suggest
[[1: Effect|1]].)


# How do I continue listening?

In any order you like.
