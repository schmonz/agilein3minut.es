Regarding your first one, I would suggest we make a distinction between values, principles, and practices (similar to the \"agile onion\").  And that this will help us become better \"agile mindset change agents\" I would be interested in what you think of my framework: https://bit.ly/2OCZaaY

Love the lean podcast approach and I am also wondering if it could help with the Accenture _Form_ workshops.
