I don't offer a precise definition of "Agile," because I don't
believe we need to judge whether we are or are not. What we need
is to:

- Make risks visible early,
- Make informed decisions often, and
- Deliver value early and often.

If you agree, and you want your thoughts happily provoked, this
show is for you. Try the newest episode...

## My Goals

7. Demonstrate my respect for your time, attention, intelligence,
   and humanity.

7. Write, edit, and record every episode with such care that it
   might wind up being your favorite.

7. Release new episodes regularly, until we've covered every topic
   you could possibly want to hear about.

7. Within these constraints, experiment freely.
