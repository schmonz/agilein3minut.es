## My Goals

7. Demonstrate my respect for your time, attention, intelligence,
   and humanity.

7. Write, edit, and record every episode with such care that it
   might wind up being your favorite.

7. Release new episodes regularly, until we've covered every topic
   you could possibly want to hear about.

7. Within these constraints, experiment freely.
